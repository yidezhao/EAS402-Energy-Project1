In the project, we analyze the data from three different sources and did a Principle Component Analysis(PCA) to extract the features. Then, different linear regression models are compared to find the best one to predict an index between 0 and 1.

### Principle Component Analysis(PCA)

### Linear Regression
Linear regression   

Ridge regression    (with alpha = 1)

Ridge regression    (with alpha = 100)

Lasso regression    (with alpha = 1)   -- has sparsity problem where many predictions are 0.
